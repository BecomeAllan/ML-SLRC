0,4,"  An Artificial Intelligence system was developed and implemented for water, wastewater, and reuse plants to improve management of sensors, short and long-term maintenance plans, asset and investment management plans. It is based on an integrated approach to capture data from different computer systems and files. It adds a layer of intelligence to the data. It serves as a repository of key current and future operations and maintenance conditions that a plant needs have knowledge of. With this information, it can simulate the configuration of processes and assets for those conditions to improve or optimize operations, maintenance and asset management, using the IViewOps (Intelligent View of Operations) model. Based on the optimization through model runs, it is able to create output files that can feed data to other systems and inform the staff regarding optimal solutions to the conditions experienced or anticipated in the future.","An Artificial Intelligence Platform for Asset Management Contributes to Better Decision-making Tools for Operations, Maintenance, and Utility Management.",0
1,7,"Abstract Cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) is one of the more popular EOR techniques due to the existence of giant heavy oil reserves existing in different parts of the world. Numerical reservoir simulation plays a critical role in investigating the mechanisms and optimizing field development strategies of CSS processes. An artificial neural network (ANN) based model is considered to be a powerful subsidiary tool of high fidelity models for its fast computational speed and reliable prediction capability. This work focuses on the development of a robust surrogate model as a screening/design tool for cyclic steam injection processes using artificial neural network technology. The major contribution of this work includes training of the ANN model using a network topology optimization workflow to help the ANN better understand the complex data structures that are encountered in such processes. The developed ANN model successfully incorporates rock-fluid properties such as relative permeability and temperature dependent viscosity as input parameters together with the other relevant data. Last but not least, the network model utilizes a hybrid structure to adapt to the automatic cycle switching scheme that can be encountered in cyclic steam injection processes. The paper shows that the ANN model can be employed both as a classification tool and a nonlinear regression tool. The model is validated via extensive blind tests against high fidelity simulation models and can be used as a powerful screening and process design tool in global optimization of the process.",Structuring an artificial intelligence based decision making tool for cyclic steam stimulation processes,0

Strategic planning and many other technical decisions are significant to these strategic systems. The proposed Artificial Intelligent (AI) methods provide decision makers with different choices for investment, where each is comprised of different desalination combinations regarding to locations, capacities, and energy sources in terms of several performance metrics. The intelligent decisions determine the optimal stations location and the water desalination system capacity for future expectations. Other smart decisions select the optimal desalination technologies for available existing and suggested desalination planting. In addition, AI methods provide decision makers to configure the pipeline network and transport water among the planting locations. The proposed work is a method to upkeep strategic decision making for the best water desalination facility. Our methodology offers a set of AI alternatives for several desalination plans. Decision support systems and tools are imperfect to deliver a set of alternatives. Therefore, the proposed work provides a systematic decision process to validate several water desalination alternatives, considering intelligent water pumping to the locations through the pumping network and water storage at every location.

3,10,"Air Traffic Management (ATM) is a complex decision-making process. Air traffic controllers' decision on aircraft trajectory control actions directly leads to the efficiency of traffic flow management. In the Automated Point Merge Trajectory Planning (APMTP) problem, it aims to realize an automated routine trajectory management in Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) with an intelligent decision-making agent. An Artificial Intelligence-based approach, mainly Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, is applied to adaptively and smartly integrate four types of de-conflict actions for solving conflicts with fewer delays on the environment. In this paper, we will mainly discuss the policy optimization in APMTP, focus on improving the agent's learning quality and exploration efficiency. Firstly, application of RL in adaptive trajectory planning is presented. APMTP problem is adaptively divided into several sub-problems. For each sub-problem, an online policy π is applied to guide the simulation and optimization modules to find out the conflict-free and less-delay solution. The online policy π is a scale of weight distribution for choosing desirable actions. It follows the rule of Roulette-wheel selection with weighted probability. The highest desirable decision variable has the largest share of the roulette wheel, while the lowest desirable decision variable has the smallest share of the roulette wheel. The RL direct policy optimization algorithm is designed to update the online policy π, Finally, experiments are built up for validation of the proposed policy optimization algorithm for the intelligent decision-making in APMTP. The results in the test environment show that learning agent with different exploration and exploitation ability will result in different system performance in conflict resolution and delay.",Policy Optimization in Automated Point Merge Trajectory Planning: An Artificial Intelligence-based Approach,0

6,37,"ABSTRACT Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches in combination with Raman spectroscopy (RS) to obtain accurate medical diagnosis and decision-making is a way forward for understanding not only the chemical pathway to the progression of disease, but also for tailor-made personalized medicine. These processes remove unwanted affects in the spectra such as noise, fluorescence and normalization, and help in the optimization of spectral data by employing chemometrics. Methods: In this study, breast cancer tissues have been analyzed by RS in conjunction with principal component (PCA) and linear discriminate (LDA) analyses. Tissue microarray (TMA) breast biopsies were investigated using RS and chemometric methods and classified breast biopsies into luminal A, luminal B, HER2, and triple negative subtypes. Results: Supervised and unsupervised algorithms were applied on biopsy data to explore intra and inter data set biochemical changes associated with lipids, collagen, and nucleic acid content. LDA predicted specificity accuracy of luminal A, luminal B, HER2, and triple negative subtypes were 70%, 100%, 90%, and 96.7%, respectively.

7,51,"The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) first appeared a few decades ago. Today, by the ubiquitous wireless connectivity, the boost of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and the advances in big data analytics, it is safe to say that IoT has evolved to a new concept called the Internet of Everything (IoE) or the Internet of All. IoE has four pillars, things, human, data, and processes, which render it as an inhomogeneous large-scale network. A crucial challenge of such a network is to develop management, analysis, and optimization policies that besides utility-maximizer machines, also take irrational humans into account.

10,84,"Abstraction and hierarchical information-processing are hallmarks of human and animal intelligence underlying the unrivaled flexibility of behavior in biological systems. Achieving such a flexibility in artificial systems is challenging, even with more and more computational power. Here we investigate the hypothesis that abstraction and hierarchical information-processing might in fact be the consequence of limitations in information-processing power. In particular, we study an information-theoretic framework of bounded rational decision-making that trades off utility maximization against information-processing costs. We apply the basic principle of this framework to perception-action systems with multiple information-processing nodes and derive bounded optimal solutions. We show how the formation of abstractions and decision-making hierarchies depends on information-processing costs. We illustrate the theoretical ideas with example simulations and conclude by formalizing a mathematically unifying optimization principle that could potentially be extended to more complex systems.","Bounded Rationality, Abstraction, and Hierarchical Decision-Making: An Information-Theoretic Optimality Principle",0
